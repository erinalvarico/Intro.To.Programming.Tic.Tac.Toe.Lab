# Intro.To.Programming.Tic.Tac.Toe.Lab
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe program that can be played with two users. Made in PyCharm in Python.

As frustrating as it was, this lab once again, was one of my personal favorites. I worked with my classmate on debugging and correcting the missing code in the provided resources. Here is the initial assignment given to my class:

Initial goal:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the attached file.

Modify the file as directed in the comments. When complete, you should have a basic tic-tac-toe board and be able to specify a row and column and see an "x" or an "o" placed in the board or receive a "Space already taken" message. The code will not actually find a winner--that is more complex and can be done for a final project (would prefer you use graphics and mouse click instead of drawing the grid and prompting for row and column if you do decide to make this your final project). See attached screen captures for the expected output and decision making process.

Upload the file and submit for grading.

The professor also gave the opportunity of extra credit (2 points) in which I recieved for adding additional, unecessary tweaks. The program works wonderfully!

In the attached files of this repository (not the sourcecode) are the initial files given to us as examples (ttt1 and ttt2) for what the output code should provide, and the starting code that each student needed to edit and refine (Starting File Py).
